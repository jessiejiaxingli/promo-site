The song was released as the lead single from their debut studio album, <em>My Head Is An Animal</em> (2011). It was also released on the band's EP Into the Woods. It was written by primary vocalists Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir and Ragnar Þórhallsson, and produced by Aron Þór Arnarsson. <br><br> Chorus: <br> "Don't listen to a word I say <br> The screams all sound the same <br> Though the truth may vary, this <br> Ship will carry our <br> Bodies safe to shore." <br><br> <a href="https://youtu.be/ghb6eDopW8I?si=hoVaL6ejacuTMOnF"> Little Talks on Youtube.</a> </p>
